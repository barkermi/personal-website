Topics covered include: Part 107 regulations, aircraft platforms and sensors, study design, automated flight planning, image processing, orthomosaic generation with Agisoft Metashape, and creation of secondary products including vegetation indices, point clouds, and surface models. Students also receive hands-on flight training and produce a scientific manuscript.\r\nWinter\r\nFE 257 GIS and Forest Engineering Applications\r\nInstructor: Michael Wing, PhD\r\nUndergraduate students are introduced to geographic information systems (GIS) in the context of forest management. Students learn to execute geospatial processing tasks and are introduced to fundamental geomatics. Additionally, the course covers GPS and introduces remote sensing techniques.The course currently implements ESRI ArcGIS Pro software, graciously provided through Oregon State University.\r\nSpring\r\nFE 472 Mechanized Harvesting and Simulation\r\nInstructor: Jeffrey Wimer\r\nGEOG 462/562\r\nInstructor: Robert Kennedy, PhD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
